TODO:
    be able to move back and forth between uniformly random over sum dimension, and uniformly random over split

    so
    A <-$ Matrix_{n,m}
    u <-$ Matrix_{n,1}

    is equiv to
    Au <-$ Matrix_{n,m+1}
    let A = sl Au
    let u = sr Au

(this is needed to apply the lwe assumption)

we also need to go back, after the lwe assumption is made

so if we have 
    Au <-$ Matrix_{n,m+1}
    let u = sr Au
    then we can transform into
    A <-$ Matrix_{n,m}
    u <-$ Matrix_{n,1}
